# BearEats


At WASHU, keeping track of your macronutrients and calories is difficult. So, our group created a simple food tracker to help students reach their fitness goals. 

On the home page, the viewer is shown a ratio of their current macros and their macro goals for the day through easy-to-interpret bars. Below is a log of every food eaten that day.

By going to settings, the user can edit their daily goals, since everyone has vastly different needs depending on their sex, weight, goals, and more. 

By clicking the add meal button, the user can choose what restaurant he or she will eat at and select a meal. Below, there is a visualization, showing how that meal will affect their daily goals. Â After choosing the meal, the meal will be logged on the home page and the stats will be adjusted accordingly.

If the user is unsure of what to eat or having trouble picking a food that fits their macros, our application has an algorithm to pick a random meal that most closely fits their needs for the day using Euclidean distance. If the suggested option is not to their taste, they can cycle through other viable options until a desired food is found.
